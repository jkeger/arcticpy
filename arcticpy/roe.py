""" 
The properties of readout electronics (ROE) used to operate a CCD.

(Works equally well for clocking electrons in an n-type CCD or holes in a p-type 
CCD.)

Three different clocking modes are available:
1) Standard readout, in which photoelectrons are created during an exposure, and
   read out (through different numbers of intervening pixels) to the readout
   electronics.
2) Charge Injection Line, in which electrons are injected at the far end of the
   CCD, by a charge injection structure. All travel the same distance to the
   readout electronics.
3) Trap pumping, in which electrons are shuffled backwards and forwards many 
   times, but end up in the same place as they began.
   
By default, or if the dwell_times variable has only one element, the pixel-to-
pixel transfers are assumed to happen instantly, in one step. This recovers the 
behaviour of earlier versions of ArCTIC (written in java, IDL, or C++). If 
instead a list of n dwell_times is provided, it is assumed that each pixel 
contains n phases in which electrons are stored during intermediate steps of the 
readout sequence. The number of phases should match that in the instance of a 
CCD class, and the units of dwell_times should match those in the instance of a 
Traps class.

Unlike CCD pixels, where row 1 is closer to the readout register than row 2, 
phase 2 is closer than phase 1:
+-----------
| Pixel n:  
|   Phase 0 
|   Phase 1 
|   Phase 2 
+-----------
|    .       
     .
|    .       
+-----------
| Pixel 1:  
|   Phase 0 
|   Phase 1 
|   Phase 2 
+-----------
| Pixel 0:  
|   Phase 0 
|   Phase 1 
|   Phase 2 
+-----------
| Readout

        clock_sequence : [[ROEPhase]]
            An array of, for each step in a clock sequence, for each phase of 
            the CCD, an object with information about the potentials.
        
        Assumptions:
         * Instant transfer between phases; no traps en route.
         * Electrons released from traps in 'low' phases may be recaptured into 
           the same traps or at the bottom of the (nonexistent) potential well,
           depending on the trap_manager functions.
         * At the end of the step, electrons released from traps in 'low' phases 
           are moved instantly to the charge cloud in the nearest 'high' phase. 
           The electrons are exposed to no traps en route (which is reasonable 
           if their capture timescale is nonzero).
         * Electrons that move in this way to trailing charge clouds (higher  
           pixel numbers) can/will be captured during step of readout. Electrons 
           that move to forward charge clouds would be difficult, and are 
           handled by the difference between conceptualisation and 
           implementation of the sequence. 
        
        If self.n_steps=1, this generates the most simplistic readout clocking 
        sequence, in which every pixel is treated as a single phase, with  
        instant transfer of an entire charge cloud to the next pixel.
         
        For three phases, the diagram below conceptually represents the six 
        steps for trap pumping, where charge clouds in high-potential phases 
        are shifted first left then back right, or only the first three steps 
        for normal readout, where the charge clouds are shifted continuously 
        left towards the readout register.
        
        A trap species in a phase of pixel p could capture electrons when that
        phase's potential is high and a charge cloud is present. The "Capture 
        from" lines refer to the original pixel that the cloud was in. So in  
        step 3, the charge cloud originally in pixel p+1 has been moved into 
        pixel p. For trap pumping, the cloud is then moved back. In normal 
        readout it would continue moving towards pixel p-1. The "Release to" 
        lines state the pixel to which electrons released by traps in that phase 
        will move, essentially into the closest high-potential phase.

        Note: Doing this with low values of express means that electrons 
        released from a 'low' phase and moving forwards (e.g. p-1 above) do not
        necessarily have the chance to be recaptured (depending on the release 
        routines in trap_manager, they could be recaptured at the "bottom" of a 
        nonexistent potential well, and that is fairly likely because of the 
        large volume of their charge cloud). If they do not get captured, and 
        tau_c << tau_r (as is usually the case), then this produces a spurious 
        leakage of charge from traps. To give them more opportunity to be 
        recaptured, we make sure we always end each series of phase-to-phase 
        transfers with a high phase that will always allow capture. The release 
        operations omitted are irrelevant, because either they were implemented 
        during the previous step, or the traps must have been empty anyway.
        
        If there are an even number of phases, electrons released equidistant 
        from two high phases are split in half and sent in both directions. This 
        choice means that it should be possible (and fastest) to implement such 
        readout using only two phases, with a long dwell time in the phase that 
        represents all the 'low' phases.

            for single-step clocking, or a list for multi-step clocking; the

            Physically, the first ixel that a charge cloud finds itself in will
            start with empty traps; whereas every subsequent transfer sees traps 
            that may have been filled previously. With the default express 
            algorithm, this means the inherently different first-transfer would 
            be replicated many times for some pixels but not others. This 
            modification prevents that issue by modelling the first single 
            transfer for each pixel separately and then using the express 
            algorithm normally for the remainder.
                   
        empty_traps_between_columns : bool
            True:  each column has independent traps (appropriate for parallel

            False: each column moves through the same traps, which therefore
                   preserve occupancy, allowing trails to extend onto the next

        To reduce runtime, instead of calculating the effects of every 
        pixel-to-pixel transfer, it is possible to approximate readout by 
        processing each transfer once (Anderson et al. 2010) or a few times 
        (Massey et al. 2014, section 2.1.5), then multiplying the effect of
        that transfer by the number of transfers it represents. This function
        computes the multiplicative factor, and returns it in a matrix that can 
        be easily looped over.

        Parameters
        ----------

            The number of pixels in the image, or the subset of pixels to model.

            (low values).
                n_pix   (slower, accurate) Compute every pixel-to-pixel 
                        transfer. The default 0 = alias for n_pix.
                k       Recompute on k occasions the effect of each transfer.  
                        After a few transfers (and e.g. eroded leading edges),  
                        the incremental effect of subsequent transfers can 
                        change.
                1       (faster, approximate) Compute the effect of each

            Runtime scales approximately as O(express^0.5). ###WIP
