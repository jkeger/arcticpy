ccd.py

    - Why not just make the CCD use lists by default (size 1 for single phase), or make the clocking algorithm take a
      list of CCDs?

    - Make all functions which use a .setter use a decorator to handle the n_phases list.
    -  CCDs in the Hubble Space Telescope are primarily density-driven; TYPO?
    - Lines 213-218 delete?

traps.py

    - timmescale -> time?
    - total_trapss -> total_traps
    - distribution_of_traps_with_lifetime, will cause problems with model-fitting. How many of these are there? Could
      make different TrapLifetimeContinuum classes for each. Looks like you've already done that or LogNormal. I guess
      we should call TrapLifetimeContinuum -> AbstractTrapLifetimeContinuum

    - Split test_traps.py and test_traps_managers.py. May want some tests of Trap instances alone not using the
      TrapManager.

traps_manager.py

    - single trap species is supplied, still make sure it is a list -> of a list?
    - For AllTrapsManager, ccd should be mandatory input and not default=None?
    - lines 76 -> 88, can we implement a trap_manager_from_traps_and_n_pixels function in the Trap classes?
    - self.n_electrons_trapped_previously -> typo? Superflous?
    - TrapManager -> , ccd=CCD(), phase=0 confusing inputs.
    - 466, where_increased not used?
    - Might be nice to split TrapManager and have a trap_manager_util or something for the big processing steps. Could
      split some of the if loops up into differents this way. Might be tricky with self.watermarks.

- Might be nice to get a lot of the long blocks of code into standaloe functions, but not a huge deal.
- Remove unused code, commented out code, etc.
