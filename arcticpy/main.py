    Add CTI trails to an image by trapping, releasing, and moving electrons 
    along their independent columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : [[float]]
        The input array of pixel values, assumed to be in units of electrons.
        
        The first dimension is the "row" index, the second is the "column" 
        index. By default (for parallel clocking), charge is transferred "up" 
        from row n to row 0 along each independent column. i.e. the readout 
        register is above row 0. (For serial clocking, the image is rotated 
        beforehand, outside of this function, see add_cti().)
        
        e.g. (with arbitrary trap parameters)
        Initial image with one bright pixel in the first three columns:
            [[0.0,     0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [200.0,   0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [0.0,     200.0,   0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [0.0,     0.0,     200.0,   0.0  ], 
             [0.0,     0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [0.0,     0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ]]
        Final image with CTI trails behind each bright pixel:
            [[0.0,     0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [196.0,   0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [3.0,     194.1,   0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [2.0,     3.9,     192.1,   0.0  ], 
             [1.3,     2.5,     4.8,     0.0  ], 
             [0.8,     1.5,     2.9,     0.0  ]]
        
    roe : ROE
        An object describing the timing and direction(s) in which electrons are 
        moved during readout.
        
    ccd : CCD
        An object describing the way in which a cloud of electrons fills the CCD 
        volume. 
        
    traps : [Trap] or [[Trap]]
        A list of one or more trap objects. To use different types of traps that
        will require different watermark levels, pass a 2D list of lists, i.e. a 
        list containing lists of one or more traps for each type. 
        
    express : int
        The number of times the pixel-to-pixel transfers are computed, 
        determining the balance between accuracy (high values) and speed 
        (low values) (Massey et al. 2014, section 2.1.5).
            n_pix   (slower, accurate) Compute every pixel-to-pixel 
                    transfer. The default 0 = alias for n_pix.
            k       Recompute on k occasions the effect of each transfer.  
                    After a few transfers (and e.g. eroded leading edges),  
                    the incremental effect of subsequent transfers can change.
            1       (faster, approximate) Compute the effect of each 
                    transfer only once.
        Runtime scales approximately as O(express^0.5). ###WIP
        
    offset : int (>= 0)
        The number of (e.g. prescan) pixels separating the supplied image from 
        the readout register.
        
    window_row_range : range
        The subset of row pixels to model, to save time when only a specific 
        region of the image is of interest. Defaults to range(0, n_pixels) for 
        the full image.
    
    window_column_range : range
        The subset of column pixels to model, to save time when only a specific 
        region of the image is of interest. Defaults to range(0, n_columns) for 
        the full image.
        
    time_window_range : range
        The subset of transfers to implement. Defaults to range(0, n_pixels) for 
        the full image. e.g. range(0, n_pixels/3) to do only the first third of 
        the pixel-to-pixel transfers.
        
        The entire readout is still modelled, but only the results from this 
        subset of transfers are implemented in the final image.

    """
    Add CTI trails to an image by trapping, releasing, and moving electrons
    along their independent columns, for parallel and/or serial clocking.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : [[float]]
        The input array of pixel values, assumed to be in units of electrons.
        
        The first dimension is the "row" index, the second is the "column" 
        index. By default (for parallel clocking), charge is transfered "up" 
        from row n to row 0 along each independent column. i.e. the readout 
        register is above row 0. (For serial clocking, the image is rotated 
        before modelling, such that charge moves from column n to column 0.)
        
        e.g. (with arbitrary trap parameters)
        Initial image with one bright pixel in the first three columns:
            [[0.0,     0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [200.0,   0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [0.0,     200.0,   0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [0.0,     0.0,     200.0,   0.0  ], 
             [0.0,     0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [0.0,     0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ]]
        Image with parallel CTI trails:
            [[0.0,     0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [196.0,   0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [3.0,     194.1,   0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [2.0,     3.9,     192.1,   0.0  ], 
             [1.3,     2.5,     4.8,     0.0  ], 
             [0.8,     1.5,     2.9,     0.0  ]]
        Final image with parallel and serial CTI trails:
            [[0.0,     0.0,     0.0,     0.0  ], 
             [194.1,   1.9,     1.5,     0.9  ], 
             [2.9,     190.3,   2.9,     1.9  ], 
             [1.9,     3.8,     186.5,   3.7  ], 
             [1.2,     2.4,     4.7,     0.9  ], 
             [0.7,     1.4,     2.8,     0.6  ]]
        
    parallel_express : int
        The number of times the transfers are computed, determining the 
        balance between accuracy (high values) and speed (low values), for 
        parallel clocking (Massey et al. 2014, section 2.1.5).
        
    parallel_roe : ROE
        The object describing the clocking read-out electronics for parallel
        clocking.
        
    parallel_ccd : CCD
        The object describing the CCD volume for parallel clocking. For
        multi-phase clocking optionally use a list of different CCD volumes
        for each phase, in the same size list as parallel_roe.dwell_times.
        
    parallel_traps : [Trap] or [[Trap]]
        A list of one or more trap objects for parallel clocking. To use
        different types of traps that will require different watermark
        levels, pass a 2D list of lists, i.e. a list containing lists of
        one or more traps for each type.
        
    parallel_offset : int (>= 0)
        The number of (e.g. prescan) pixels separating the supplied image from 
        the readout register. i.e. Treat the input image as a sub-image that is 
        offset this number of pixels from readout, increasing the number of
        pixel-to-pixel transfers.
        
    parallel_window_range : range
        For speed, calculate only the effect on this subset of pixels. Defaults
        to range(0, n_pixels) for the full image.
        
        For a single pixel (e.g. for trap pumping), can enter just the single 
        integer index, which will be converted to range(index, index + 1).
        
        Note that, because of edge effects, you should start the range several
        pixels before the actual region of interest.
        
    serial_* : *
        The same as the parallel_* objects described above but for serial
        clocking instead.
        
    time_window_range : range
        The subset of transfers to implement. Defaults to range(0, n_pixels) for 
        the full image. e.g. range(0, n_pixels/3) to do only the first third of 
        the pixel-to-pixel transfers.
        
        The entire readout is still modelled, but only the results from this 
        subset of transfers are implemented in the final image.
        
        This could be used to e.g. add cosmic rays during readout of simulated
        images. Successive calls to complete the readout should start at
        the same value that the previous one ended, e.g. range(0, 1000) then
        range(1000, 2000). Be careful not to divide the readout too finely, as 
        there is only as much temporal resolution as there are rows (not rows * 
        phases) in the image. Also, for each time that readout is split between
        successive calls to this function, the output in one row of pixels
        will change slightly (unless express=0) because trap occupancy is
        not stored between calls.

    Returns

    """
    Remove CTI trails from an image by first modelling the addition of CTI.
    
    See add_cti()'s documentation for the forward modelling. This function 
    iteratively models the addition of more CTI trails to the input image to 
    then extract the corrected image without the original trails.

    Parameters
    ----------
    All parameters are identical to those of add_cti() as described in its 
    documentation, with the exception of:
    
    iterations : int
        The number of times CTI-adding clocking is run to perform the correction 
        via forward modelling. 

    Returns
    -------
    image : [[float]]
        The output array of pixel values with CTI removed.
